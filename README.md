# 🔥 Chain Breaker

> *Break the chains of perception in this digital age*

A memory puzzle game inspired by **Red Devil's Reign** — aggressive digital dubstep with a cyber-hell aesthetic.

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Game

Memorize demonic symbol sequences. Recreate them to break the chains.

Three paths await:
- **Mortal** — 5 lives, forgiving timing
